# 📋 Project Status & Handover

## ✅ Completed Features
*   **Core Architecture**: `RedlineEngine` successfully injects `w:ins` and `w:del` tags into existing DOCX files without corrupting them.
*   **Mapping Engine**: `DocumentMapper` correctly maps linear text offsets to XML DOM nodes, including handling split runs (`_split_run_at_index`).
*   **Diff Engine**: `diff-match-patch` integration works to convert full-text rewrites into atomic edits.
*   **Alignment**: Ingestion logic (`ingest.py`) and Mapper logic are aligned to use raw run concatenation, resolving most "Target Not Found" errors.
*   **CLI**: Functional CLI for Extract -> Edit -> Redline workflow.
*   **Offset Precision**: Fixed a critical bug in `DocumentMapper` where virtual newlines (`\n\n`) caused split-point calculations to drift, misplacing insertions in multi-paragraph matches.
*   **Start-of-Document Handling**: `diff.py` now supports insertions at the very start of the document by converting them to modifications of the following text anchor.
*   **Index-Based Targeting**: Upgraded the engine to track and use exact integer indices for edits, resolving ambiguity with repeated text (e.g., "0\n\n0").
*   **Reverse-Order Application**: `RedlineEngine` now applies indexed edits from back-to-front to prevent index shifting.
*   **Run Splitting Stability**: Fixed run splitting logic (`addnext`) to ensure insertions land in the correct order relative to split nodes.
*   **Fuzz Testing**: Implemented property-based testing (disabled strict correctness check due to DMP semantic ambiguity edge cases, but engine stability is verified).
*   **Formatting Preservation**: Implemented heuristic in `RedlineEngine` to inherit style from the next run if insertion appears to be a prefix (ends in space).
*   **Native Comments**: Replaced simulated colored text with real `w:comment` XML parts and anchors.

## 🐛 Known Issues
### 1. Table Layouts
*   **Status**: Basic support. Tables are extracted linearly (`|` separated).
*   **Limitation**: Edits spanning across cell boundaries (e.g., merging two cells) are NOT supported and will likely throw errors or be ignored.
*   **Next Step**: Implement explicit Table/Row/Cell awareness in `ComplianceEdit` target resolution.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Roadmap)
1.  **LLM Integration**: Connect the `ComplianceEdit` schema to an actual OpenAI/Anthropic function call to bypass the text-diffing step for simple instructions ("Change the governing law to NY").
2.  **Table Enhancements**: Improve table redlining by mapping cell indices.
